# thread_small_rng

This is a rust crate that enables multi-threaded Monte Carlo studies. It constructs a random number generator per thread and advances the random number generator so that each thread has access to an independent stream of random numbers. This will work best when using a fixed number of threads in a thread-pool as is done with the rayon crate. You can set a global seed for reproducible results or let each generator be seeded by system entropy. It is basically copied directly from the rand crate but with the addition of a global seed and a thread counter for jumping the generator. Pseudorandom numbers are generated using xoshiro256plusplus from the rand_xoshiro crate. This crate is not suitable for applications requiring a cryptographically secure generator. Use rand::thread_rng() for those applications.
